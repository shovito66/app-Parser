<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call.

Failure to do so will allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Potientially vulnerable check permission function called</h2>
Be careful with use of Check permission function
App maybe vulnerable to Privilege escalation or Confused Deputy Attack. This function can grant access to malicious application, lacking the appropriate permission, by assuming your applications permissions. This means a malicious application, without appropriate permissions, can bypass its permission check by using your applicationpermission to get access to otherwise denied resources. Use - checkCallingPermission instead. Reference: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Ordered broadcast sent with receiverPermission with minimum SDK under 21</h2>
A broadcast, sendOrderedBroadcast which specifies the receiverPermission, but may still be vulnerable to interception, due to the permission squatting vulnerability in API levels before 21. This means any application, installed prior to the expected receiver(s) on the device can potentially receive this broadcast. You should investigate this for potential data leakage. <br/><br/>

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all.

The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

The Content provider API provides a method call.

Failure to do so will allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

Be careful with use of Check permission function
App maybe vulnerable to Privilege escalation or Confused Deputy Attack. This function can grant access to malicious application, lacking the appropriate permission, by assuming your applications permissions. This means a malicious application, without appropriate permissions, can bypass its permission check by using your applicationpermission to get access to otherwise denied resources. Use - checkCallingPermission instead. Reference: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all.

Failure to do so will allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING External storage used</h2>
Reading files stored on {storage_location} makes it vulnerable to data injection attacks. Note that this code does no error checking and there is no security enforced with these files. For example, any application holding WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE can write to these files. Reference: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html <br/><br/>

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Potientially vulnerable check permission function called</h2>
Be careful with use of Check permission function
App maybe vulnerable to Privilege escalation or Confused Deputy Attack. This function can grant access to malicious application, lacking the appropriate permission, by assuming your applications permissions. This means a malicious application, without appropriate permissions, can bypass its permission check by using your applicationpermission to get access to otherwise denied resources. Use - checkCallingPermission instead. Reference: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html
